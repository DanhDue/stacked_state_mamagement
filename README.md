Flutter sample code base.
=============================================

A project based on Stacked State Management architecture.

Introduction
------------

This project is a sample code base that implements the MVVM architecture and uses Flutter Stacked State Management Architecture.

Technical Information used in this project:

1. Programming Language: [Flutter - Dart][0].
2. Architecture: [MVVM architecture][1] based on [Stacked State Management Architecture][2].  For more resources on learning Flutter development, visit the [Developer Guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) at [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/).
3. Flutter Components: ....
4. Multiple Threads: [Future][].
5. Third Party Libraries: [Stacked State Management][2], [Get It][5], [Vexana][6], [Dio][7], [Fimber][9], [etc][14],...
6. Unit Test: ...
7. [ScreenShots][15]

Implementation
--------------
Flutter version management is a big trouble that any Flutter developers have to face in their development process.
So, in this project, I have used the FVM([Flutter Version Management][18]) package to manage it easily, rapidly, and conveniently.

To install this app, you can see at FVM official [page][19].
Here, I only show you some steps to run this sample.

1. Flutter version 2.8.1 is used for this project:
```
fvm use 2.8.1
```

2. FVM setup for the Android Studio:

</p>

3. FVM setup for the VSCode:
Create a settings.json file on ~/.vscode folder and paste content below:
```
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": ".fvm/flutter_sdk",
  // Remove .fvm files from search
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  },
  // Remove from file watching
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  },
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
}
```

Libraries Used
--------------
